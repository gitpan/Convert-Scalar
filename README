NAME
    Convert::Scalar - convert between different representations of perl
    scalars

SYNOPSIS
     use Convert::Scalar;

DESCRIPTION
    This module exports various internal perl methods that change the
    internal representation or state of a perl scalar. All of these work
    in-place, that is, they modify their scalar argument. No functions are
    exported by default.

    The following export tags exist:

     :utf8   all functions with utf8 in their names
     :taint  all functions with taint in their names

    utf8 scalar[, mode]
        Returns true when the given scalar is marked as utf8, false
        otherwise. If the optional mode argument is given, also forces the
        interpretation of the string to utf8 (mode true) or plain bytes
        (mode false). The actual (byte-) content is not changed. The return
        value always reflects the state before any modifications is done.

        This function is useful when you "import" utf8-data into perl, or
        when some external function (e.g. storing/retrieving from a
        database) removes the utf8-flag.

    utf8_on scalar
        Similar to `utf8 scalar, 1', but additionally returns the scalar
        (the argument is still modified in-place).

    utf8_off scalar
        Similar to `utf8 scalar, 0', but additionally returns the scalar
        (the argument is still modified in-place).

    utf8_valid scalar [Perl 5.7]
        Returns true if the bytes inside the scalar form a valid utf8
        string, false otherwise (the check is independent of the actual
        encoding perl thinks the string is in).

    utf8_upgrade scalar
        Convert the string content of the scalar in-place to its
        UTF8-encoded form (and also returns it).

    utf8_downgrade scalar[, fail_ok=0]
        Attempt to convert the string content of the scalar from
        UTF8-encoded to ISO-8859-1. This may not be possible if the string
        contains characters that cannot be represented in a single byte; if
        this is the case, it leaves the scalar unchanged and either returns
        false or, if `fail_ok' is not true (the default), croaks.

    utf8_encode scalar
        Convert the string value of the scalar to UTF8-encoded, but then
        turn off the `SvUTF8' flag so that it looks like bytes to perl
        again. (Might be removed in future versions).

    utf8_length scalar
        Returns the number of characters in the string, counting wide UTF8
        characters as a single character, independent of wether the scalar
        is marked as containing bytes or mulitbyte characters.

    unmagic scalar
        Removes magic from the scalar.

    weaken scalar
        Weaken a reference. (See also the WeakRef manpage).

    taint scalar
        Taint the scalar.

    tainted scalar
        returns true when the scalar is tainted, false otherwise.

    untaint scalar, type
        Remove the specified magic from the scalar (DANGEROUS!), the
        perlguts manpage. the Untaint manpage, for a similar but different
        interface.

    grow scalar, newlen
        Sets the memory area used for the scalar to the given length, if the
        current length is less than the new value. This does not affect the
        contents of the scalar, but is only useful to "pre-allocate" memory
        space if you know the scalar will grow. The return value is the
        modified scalar (the scalar is modified in-place).

  CANDIDATES FOR FUTURE RELEASES

    The following API functions (the perlapi manpage) are considered for
    future inclusion in this module If you want them, write me.

     sv_upgrade
     sv_pvn_force
     sv_pvutf8n_force
     the sv2xx family
